### Event Objectives

-   Conduct a deep-dive into the **AWS Bedrock Agent Core** and its functional capabilities.
-   Explore practical use cases for developing complex **Agentic Workflows**.
-   Analyze advanced technical concepts (**L300**) such as **Agentic Orchestration** and **Context Optimization**.
-   Provide practical experience through the **CloudThinker Hack** workshop.

### Speakers

-   **Mr. Nguyen Gia Hung** – Head of Solutions Architect, AWS
-   **Mr. Kien Nguyen** – Solutions Architect, AWS
-   **Mr. Viet Pham** – Founder & CEO
-   **Mr. Thang Ton** – Co-founder & COO, CloudThinker
-   **Mr. Henry Bui** – Head of Engineering, CloudThinker
-   **Mr. Kha Van** – Workshop Facilitator

### Key Highlights

#### 1. AWS Foundation
-   **Program Context**: Mr. Nguyen Gia Hung introduced the strategic importance of Agentic AI within the modern cloud environment.
-   **Bedrock Agent Core Overview**: Mr. Kien Nguyen provided a technical breakdown of how AWS Bedrock Agent Core simplifies the creation of agents that can plan tasks and execute them by invoking external APIs.

#### 2. Practical Application & Use Cases
-   **Workflow Development**: Mr. Viet Pham demonstrated the full lifecycle of designing and deploying a concrete agentic workflow on AWS.
-   **Ecosystem Introduction**: Mr. Thang Ton presented the CloudThinker platform and its vision for leveraging AI in cloud solutions.

#### 3. Deep Dive (Level 300)
-   **Technical Core**: Mr. Henry Bui led the advanced session, focusing on intricate strategies for coordinating **multiple agents** (**Agentic Orchestration**) and fine-tuning prompts and context within Amazon Bedrock (**Context Optimization**) for high accuracy and cost efficiency in complex interactions.

#### 4. Hands-on Experience
-   **CloudThinker Hack**: Mr. Kha Van facilitated a 60-minute practical session where attendees prototyped an agent using the CloudThinker framework and various AWS services, reinforcing the theoretical lessons.

### Key Takeaways

#### Evolution of AI
-   **From Chat to Action**: The industry is evolving from simple, passive chatbots to active **Agents** capable of complex orchestration and performing actions via API calls.
-   **Cost & Accuracy**: As AI complexity grows, sophisticated **Context Optimization** is vital to maintain high accuracy while efficiently managing token usage and associated costs.

#### Architecture
-   **Orchestration Patterns**: Building reliable multi-agent systems requires a robust orchestration layer to strategically manage the flow of user requests and distribute tasks among specialized agents.

### Applying to Work

-   **Agent Prototyping**: I plan to use AWS Bedrock Agent to develop a simple internal tool that can execute an action via a company API (e.g., check server status or query an internal ledger).
-   **Research Context Management**: I will study the advanced context optimization patterns shared to improve the efficiency and performance of our existing RAG implementations.
-   **Continuous Learning**: Encourage the development team to participate in similar practical workshops and hackathons to stay current with the latest AWS innovations.

### Event Experience

This event was highly technical and focused.
-   **Technical Depth**: The L300 discussion on Agentic Orchestration was particularly insightful, providing the architectural knowledge needed to scale complex AI solutions beyond simple demonstrations.
-   **Reinforcement**: The "CloudThinker Hack" was highly effective, offering immediate, practical reinforcement of the technical concepts learned in the morning sessions.
