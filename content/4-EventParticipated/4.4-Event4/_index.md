### Event Objectives

-   Present a market update on the AI/ML adoption and current trends within the local region.
-   Provide hands-on training for developing end-to-end ML models using **Amazon SageMaker**.
-   Conduct a technical deep dive into **Generative AI** capabilities on **Amazon Bedrock**, including its Foundation Models, Agents, and Guardrails.
-   Provide essential skills training in **Prompt Engineering** and the deployment of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** systems.

### Speakers

-   **AWS Experts Team**

### Key Highlights

#### Program Introduction & Networking
-   **Market Insight**: Shared an update on the current state of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning adoption across the Vietnam market.

#### AWS AI/ML Services: The SageMaker Platform
-   **Unified ML Workflow**: Detailed the complete machine learning lifecycle managed on **Amazon SageMaker**, covering data preparation, labeling, model training, tuning, and integration with **MLOps** for automated deployment.
-   **Studio Walkthrough**: A live demonstration provided a clear view of the **SageMaker Studio** interface and its professional data science features.

#### Generative AI Deep Dive with Amazon Bedrock
-   **Model Selection**: Offered criteria and comparisons for selecting the optimal Foundation Models, such as Claude, Llama, and Titan, based on specific use case requirements.
-   **Prompt Optimization**: Covered advanced **Prompt Engineering** techniques, including **Chain-of-Thought** reasoning and **Few-shot learning**.
-   **RAG Implementation**: Demonstrated the "Retrieval -> Augmentation -> Generation" architecture, focusing on how to integrate internal **Knowledge Bases** to significantly improve AI response accuracy.
-   **Advanced Controls**: Introduced **Bedrock Agents** for managing complex, multi-step tasks and **Guardrails** for ensuring content safety and regulatory compliance.
-   **Live Build**: Successfully built a functional GenAI Chatbot prototype using Amazon Bedrock during the session.

### Key Takeaways

#### Platform Strategy
-   **SageMaker's Role**: The ideal, robust platform for managing traditional, iterative **Machine Learning** development cycles with governance.
-   **Bedrock's Advantage**: Provides a fast, simplified API-based route to deploying **Generative AI** applications without the overhead of managing complex underlying infrastructure.

#### Advanced Implementation
-   **Beyond Simple Chat**: **RAG and Agents** are critical technologies that enable GenAI to move past basic interactions and solve complex, real-world business challenges and workflows.
-   **Compliance and Safety**: **Guardrails** are an obligatory component for any enterprise deployment, ensuring the AI operates within defined ethical, safety, and regulatory boundaries.

### Applying to Work

-   **Standardize MLOps**: Apply the learned SageMaker standards to automate the model lifecycle, tracking, and governance in ongoing projects.
-   **Develop RAG PoC**: Conduct experiments to integrate proprietary company documents into a Bedrock **Knowledge Base** to build a context-aware information retrieval assistant.
-   **Improve AI Quality**: Implement **Chain-of-Thought** prompting techniques to enhance the logical consistency and output quality of existing AI applications.
-   **Strategic Selection**: Utilize the learned criteria to make informed decisions when selecting Foundation Models, balancing performance requirements against cost considerations.

### Event Experience

This workshop provided a highly valuable balance between fundamental **Machine Learning** principles and contemporary **Generative AI** practices.

#### Practical Application
-   The **SageMaker Studio walkthrough** offered a clear visualization of a professional ML workflow.
-   The **Bedrock Chatbot demonstration** was a highlight, showcasing the rapid development possible for powerful GenAI applications.
